    `1. The contributions to the projects will come from the passive income generated by contributors’ FLR/SGB capital, hence never compromising on their principals and benefits that Flare and SongBird offer. Contributors will be able to give between 1% and 100% of the rewards their principal is generating to fund the projects they believe in, without ever having to hand over their actual principal in FLR or SGB.`,
    `2. The monthly FLR airdrop received from the Flare Foundation will not automatically go to the project; only a ratio of the contributor's choice from the rewards generated by the delegation to the FTSOs will go towards the project. The platform offers users the freedom to redelegate a ratio of their airdrop (or all their airdrop if they wish), and give part of their rewards to the projects they want to support, but only if they want to. `, `3. Contributors will immediately have access to an IOU of the project’s token, which will be listed upon the start of their contribution in a number of DEX partners operating on Flare. This will offer security, but also the option to exchange these IOUs without needing to wait for the distribution of the project’s native token.`, `4. At the end of their participation, contributors will still hold their principal as well as the tokens of the projects they contributed to`, `5. Our smart contracts have been audited by a Tier 1 auditing firm in the space and will behave exactly as described in this release, providing their LPs with all the necessary security throughout their contribution journey.`
