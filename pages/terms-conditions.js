            Trading in Digital Tokens (as defined in the CloudFunding Terms of
            Use) involves significant risks of financial loss. You should not
            commit to using CloudFunding Platform related Products if you are
            not prepared to lose entirely. Market prices for CloudFunding
            products can be volatile and highly unpredictable. Losses on a
            position in a CloudFunding product can occur quickly and be total
            and immediate. Whether the future market price of a Digital Token
            will move up or down is speculative and unknown.

            You should not engage in trading in Digital Tokens related to the
            CloudFunding Platform unless you understand the CloudFunding
